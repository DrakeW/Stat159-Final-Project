\title{Abstract}

In this project we address a group of administrators trying to make their school more competitive, both in diversity and graduation rates. We use the College Scorecard data to apply a predictive model in order to determine factors that may influence greater diversity and graduation rates for schools within California. For our regression analyses, we refered to \textit{An Introduction to Statistical Learning} by Gareth James et al. To learn more about the College Scorecard program which provided the data, refer to the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard Site at \url{https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)}.
